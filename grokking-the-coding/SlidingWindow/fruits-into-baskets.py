# You are visiting a farm to collect fruits. The farm has a single row of fruit trees. You will be given two baskets, and your goal is to pick as many fruits as possible to be placed in the given baskets.

# You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree. The farm has following restrictions:

# Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
# You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
# You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets

# Time complexity is O(N) because outer loop runs O(N) and the inner while will at max be O(N) as we only process each char once
# O(N + N) is equivalent to O(N)
